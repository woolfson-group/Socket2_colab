# Socket2_colab

Socket2 finds knobs-into-holes (KIH) packing between Î± -helices of protein structures (Crick, 1953; Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001). KIH packing is the structural hallmark of coiled-coil (CC) assemblies. Socket2 unambiguously defines the beginning and end of CC regions from the PDB-format structure files, and present these graphically and interactively. It also assigns heptad repeats and registers to the identified CCs, which are the sequence signatures of CC proteins (Lupas & Bassler, 2017).
